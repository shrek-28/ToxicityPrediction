# Histogram Interpretation 

The information explained in the histograms indicate the following:

| No. | Properties | Mean | Median | Skewness | Kurtosis | Distribution Shape | Biological Significance (KDE Interpretation) |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | **AliphaticRings** | 0.67 | 0.00 | 4.68 | 57.20 | Extremely right-skewed with a very strong peak at 0, indicating most molecules have no aliphatic rings. | The extremely right-skewed distribution with a dominant peak at 0 indicates that most active molecules lack aliphatic rings. This suggests that while aliphatic rings contribute to 3D shape and rigidity, their absence is common in this dataset, possibly indicating a preference for less rigid or non-aliphatic cyclic structures for optimal binding and pharmacokinetics. |
| 2. | **AromaticHeterocycles** | 0.27 | 0.00 | 2.30 | 6.05 | Highly right-skewed with a strong peak at 0, indicating most molecules have no aromatic heterocycles. | The highly right-skewed distribution with a strong peak at 0 reveals that most active molecules in this dataset do not contain aromatic heterocycles. While these are common in drugs, their general absence in this dataset suggests that for many active compounds, the essential interactions and activity do not rely on or may be hindered by their presence, although a small subset does utilize them. |
| 3. | **AromaticProportion** | 0.33 | 0.36 | 0.17 | -1.19 | Bimodal distribution with a peak at 0 and another broader peak around 0.5, suggesting a mix of aromaticity levels. | The bimodal distribution with peaks at 0 and around 0.5 indicates two significant populations within the active molecules: those with no aromatic character and those with a moderate proportion of aromatic atoms. This implies that both highly aliphatic and moderately aromatic structures are prevalent, influencing molecular rigidity, planarity, and electronic properties crucial for diverse biological interactions and stability. |
| 4. | **AromaticRings** | 1.10 | 1.00 | 1.24 | 3.61 | Right-skewed with distinct peaks at 0, 1, and 2, showing common occurrence of these ring counts. | The right-skewed distribution, with pronounced peaks at 0, 1, and 2 aromatic rings, shows that molecules with few aromatic rings are most common in the active set. This emphasizes the role of aromaticity in affecting stability and electronic properties for molecular interactions, yet suggests that a higher number of aromatic rings might be less common or optimal for this dataset's biological activity. |
| 5. | **FormalCharge** | -0.03 | 0.00 | -2.44 | 30.30 | Very sharply peaked at 0, highly kurtotic, indicating almost all molecules are neutral. Slightly left-skewed. | The extremely sharp, highly kurtotic peak at 0 indicates that the vast majority of active molecules are formally neutral. This is crucial as formal charge significantly impacts interactions with charged environments and membrane permeability, with neutrality generally favoring better permeability for drug-like molecules. |
| 6. | **FractionCSP3** | 0.46 | 0.42 | 0.24 | -1.12 | Multi-modal with peaks around 0, 0.4-0.5, and 1, suggesting diverse sp3 character. Flatter than normal distribution. | The multi-modal distribution with peaks near 0, 0.4-0.5, and 1 reveals a wide range of structural diversity in active molecules, from largely flat (low FractionCSP3) to highly three-dimensional (high FractionCSP3). This broad distribution indicates that various degrees of sp3 hybridization are tolerated or preferred, impacting solubility and binding specificity across the dataset. |
| 7. | **HalogenCount** | 0.56 | 0.00 | 5.56 | 51.63 | Extremely right-skewed with a dominant peak at 0, showing that most molecules have no halogens. | The extremely right-skewed distribution with a dominant peak at 0 indicates that most active molecules in this dataset are non-halogenated. However, the long tail suggests that a smaller proportion of molecules do contain halogens, which, when present, can significantly influence lipophilicity, reactivity, and specific binding interactions, contributing to the molecule's activity. |
| 8. | **HBAcceptors** | 3.57 | 3.00 | 4.00 | 37.44 | Highly right-skewed with a strong peak at low values, meaning many molecules have few HB acceptors. | The highly right-skewed distribution with a strong peak at low HBAcceptor values suggests that most active molecules maintain a limited number of hydrogen bond acceptors. This is crucial for optimal molecular interactions and ensuring good membrane permeability, as an excessive number of HBAcceptors can significantly impede passive diffusion across biological membranes, thus impacting oral bioavailability. |
| 9. | **HBDonors** | 1.23 | 1.00 | 5.16 | 46.16 | Highly right-skewed with a dominant peak at 0, indicating many molecules have few or no HB Donors. | The highly right-skewed distribution with a dominant peak at 0 suggests that many active molecules possess few or no hydrogen bond donors. While HBDonors are crucial for molecular recognition and binding to targets, their limited presence in this dataset suggests a balance is struck to avoid hindering membrane permeability, which is essential for drug absorption and distribution. |
| 10. | **HeavyAtoms** | 18.57 | 16.00 | 2.48 | 11.88 | Right-skewed with a peak around 10-20 heavy atoms, indicating most molecules are relatively small. | The right-skewed distribution with a prominent peak between 10 and 20 heavy atoms reveals that most active molecules in this dataset are relatively small to medium-sized. This size range is often preferred in drug discovery, as molecular size significantly influences key ADME properties such as solubility, permeability, and ease of synthesis. |
| 11. | **Heteroatoms** | 4.37 | 4.00 | 3.79 | 31.31 | Right-skewed with a peak around 3-4, indicating many molecules have a moderate number of heteroatoms. | The right-skewed distribution with a peak around 3-4 heteroatoms indicates that a moderate number of non-carbon/hydrogen atoms is prevalent in active molecules. This highlights the importance of these elements for defining crucial molecular properties like polarity and hydrogen bonding, which are critical for diverse biological interactions, while very high counts are less common. |
| 12. | **LogP** | 2.37 | 2.37 | -1.21 | 24.38 | Sharply peaked around 2-3, highly kurtotic and slightly left-skewed, indicating a strong preference for a specific lipophilicity range. | The sharply peaked, highly kurtotic distribution around a LogP of 2-3 indicates that active molecules strongly favor this moderate lipophilicity range. This balance is often considered ideal for drug-like compounds, optimizing membrane permeability (requiring some lipophilicity) while maintaining sufficient aqueous solubility (hindered by excessive lipophilicity), both critical for absorption and distribution in biological systems. |
| 13. | **LogS_ESOL** | -3.00 | -2.88 | -0.45 | 4.21 | Slightly left-skewed with a broad peak around -3. | The distribution, slightly skewed towards higher solubility values with a broad peak around LogS_ESOL of -3, suggests that most active molecules possess reasonable aqueous solubility. Good solubility is a fundamental requirement for drug formulation and bioavailability, enabling compounds to dissolve effectively and be transported to their target sites within the body. |
| 14. | **MolarRefractivity** | 72.16 | 63.67 | 2.20 | 9.56 | Right-skewed with a peak around 50-60. | The right-skewed distribution, peaking around 50-60, indicates that active molecules typically have a moderate molar refractivity. This suggests an optimal range for a molecule's total polarizability and effective volume, which are crucial for mediating dispersion forces and ensuring proper fit and interaction within the binding pockets of biological targets. |
| 15. | **Molecular Weight** | 276.32 | 240.30 | 2.58 | 12.51 | Right-skewed with a peak around 200-250 Da, showing that most molecules are relatively low molecular weight. | The right-skewed distribution with a prominent peak between 200-250 Da signifies that the majority of active molecules fall within a desirable low molecular weight range. This is biologically significant as molecular weight is a primary determinant of a compound's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, with lower molecular weights generally correlating with better oral bioavailability and membrane permeability. |
| 16. | **MolecularComplexity** | 1.13 | 1.14 | 0.02 | -0.05 | Nearly symmetrical, single peak around 1.1-1.2. | The nearly symmetrical distribution centered around a molecular complexity of 1.1-1.2 suggests that active molecules predominantly exhibit a moderate level of structural complexity. This balanced complexity is often beneficial, allowing for specific biological interactions while maintaining synthetic tractability and avoiding potential issues like promiscuous binding or metabolic liabilities often associated with excessively complex structures. |
| 17. | **NegativeCharges** | 0.14 | 0.00 | 3.94 | 19.44 | Extremely right-skewed with a very strong peak at 0. | The extremely right-skewed distribution with a dominant peak at 0 clearly indicates that most active molecules in this dataset are uncharged or lack negative charges. This is highly significant biologically, as the absence of formal charges generally enhances a molecule's ability to passively permeate cell membranes, a critical step for many drugs to reach their intracellular targets. |
| 18. | **PhenolicGroups** | 0.14 | 0.00 | 13.81 | 478.78 | Extremely right-skewed with a very strong peak at 0. | The extremely right-skewed distribution with a strong peak at 0 indicates that most active molecules do not contain phenolic groups. While relatively rare in this dataset, the presence of phenolic groups in a subset of molecules suggests their specific importance in mediating hydrogen bonding, influencing reactivity, or impacting metabolic pathways when they are indeed present in biologically active compounds. |
| 19. | **PositiveCharges** | 0.10 | 0.00 | 3.94 | 18.74 | Extremely right-skewed with a very strong peak at 0. | The extremely right-skewed distribution with a strong peak at 0 signifies that most active molecules are uncharged or lack positive charges. This is important for membrane permeability, as charged species face more challenges crossing cell membranes. However, for specific targets, the presence of a positive charge can be essential for electrostatic interactions and binding affinity. |
| 20. | **RingCount** | 1.77 | 1.00 | 2.28 | 18.41 | Right-skewed with a prominent peak at 0, 1, 2, and 3, indicating most molecules have few rings. | The right-skewed distribution with prominent peaks at 0, 1, 2, and 3 rings suggests that active molecules predominantly feature a low number of cyclic structures. This pattern indicates that a limited ring count is often optimal, balancing molecular rigidity and shape contributions to binding with the need to maintain sufficient solubility and membrane permeability, as highly polycyclic systems can sometimes be problematic for ADME properties. |
| 21. | **RotatableBonds** | 4.31 | 3.00 | 2.52 | 10.78 | Right-skewed with a peak at low values (around 1-3). | The right-skewed distribution with a strong peak at low numbers of rotatable bonds indicates that most active molecules exhibit limited conformational flexibility. This is biologically significant as controlled flexibility is crucial for effective binding to a target; excessive flexibility (many rotatable bonds) can lead to an entropic penalty upon binding, reducing affinity and potentially impacting pharmacokinetic properties like oral bioavailability. |
| 22. | **TPSA** | 59.62 | 46.53 | 4.30 | 36.64 | Right-skewed with a peak around 30-50 Å². | The right-skewed distribution, peaking around 30-50 Å², reveals that most active molecules possess a moderate to low Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA). This is highly significant in drug discovery, as TPSA is a strong predictor of passive molecular transport across biological membranes. The observed distribution suggests that the compounds in this dataset generally fall within the range (e.g., TPSA < 140 Å²) considered favorable for good cell membrane permeability and absorption. |
